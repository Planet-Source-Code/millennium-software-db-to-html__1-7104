## DB To HTML


</div>

### Description

This program demonstrates how you can take a table from a database (MS Access only in this demo) and convert all the records in that table into an HTML document for viewing in a web browser. With very little effort, you can add more HTML tags, more records, etc to have a really nice looking web page. I'm working on one that will use SQL statements to get certain information, instead of the whole thing.

The code is well commented, and any questions can be directed to me
 
### More Info
 
In order to make it work without errors, You MUST make a reference to the Microsoft DAO Library (This can be found by clicking the the PROJECT - REFERENCES menu, then scroll down the listbox until you see "Microsoft DAO 3.0 Library" (or higher)).

The database used in this demo is a database that comes with VB6 and is compatible with MS Access 97 and MS Access 2000 (it may need to be converted).
